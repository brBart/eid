Instructions for building the SWIG PHP module with GCC:

* ./build.sh

Move digidoc.so to the PHP extensions directory (consult the PHP documentation
to find out where it is on your platform) and add "extension=digidoc.so" to
php.ini, or append it to an existing "extension" option. To use the module,
include the SWIG generated digidoc.php into your PHP code. This isn't strictly
necessary, but it gives a separate namespace to the added functions to better
differentiate them.

Everything contained in the Smart Card folder was written by Olivier Rouit and originates from
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/16653/A-Smart-Card-Framework-for-NET. It is released under

Some changes were made to CardNative.cs by Tiit Pikma: exceptions return an error message
instead of just an error code.
